Here are some examples of using the pyroms package (plus maybe a few
plain python examples).

For those of us who don't have the grid information in every ROMS
output file, the gridid.txt file here is used to provide some
information to pyroms about our grids. Point to it with the
PYROMS_GRIDID_FILE environment variable.

INTERPOLATING FROM SODA:

   The Yellow_Sea directory contains code for creating a grid,
   bathymetry, initial and boundary files (the last from SODA,
   http://www.atmos.umd.edu/~ocean/).

   The Arctic2 directory has code for interpolating from SODA across all
   longitudes. It also shows how to use multiprocessing for the boundary
   conditions and climatology files - be sure to set the number of processes
   desired.

   Added a couple of SODA3 examples, but the Arctic isn't working yet.

INTERPOLATING FROM LARGER ROMS DOMAINS:

   For creating initial and boundary files from larger ROMS grids,
   there are two cases:

   1. Where the small grid is aligned with the large grid, no velocity
   rotation needed. See the Bering directory.

   2. Where the grids are not aligned and velocities need to be rotated.
   See the Beaufort example. The ice boundary script uses multiprocessing,
   by month.

   These all depend on pyroms_toolbox/remapping*.py.

INTERPOLATING FROM GLOBAL HYCOM:

    Scripts in Arctic_HYCOM - scripts to get the HYCOM files
    (subsets of the global fields) and scripts to interpolate from them.

    Also Palau_HYCOM shows how to do a non-polar subset of the HYCOM
    files.

INTERPOLATING FROM GLOBAL RUNOFF:

    Scripts in Arctic_runoff were used to convert from Dai and Trenberth
    global runoff to the ROMS coastal regions (like a second rain, but from
    rivers).

RIVERS:

    The rivers directory has stuff for turning ARDAT (Arctic Rivers)
    into ROMS sources.

NESTING:

    So far the nesting directory has only tools for processing the
    ocean_xx.in files, merging them for nested grid domains.

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FROM A STATIONS FILE:

    BC_from_sta contains one rough stab at this. Work to be done on
    volume transports.
