Most of these are suitable for a mid-latitude domain with xrange,
yrange. The Arctic had some issues with the tripole source grid, so I
hacked in a tripole option, but there are still remnant pole problems,
needing the fix_pole.py routine. It only matters for the initial
file - the Arctic directory is a copy of Initial_bio.

The climatology we were given did not contain the coastal diatom
fields (medium phyto). I was told that to create appropriate files,
split the large phyto into large and medium phyto. The scripts in
the diatoms directory do just that.
