def ap2ep(Au, PHIu, Av, PHIv, plot_demo=False):
    """
    Convert tidal amplitude and phase lag (ap-) parameters into tidal ellipse
    (ep-) parameters. Please refer to ep2ap for its inverse function.

    Usage:

    SEMA, ECC, INC, PHA, w = ap2ep(Au, PHIu, Av, PHIv, plot_demo=False)

    Where:

        Au, PHIu, Av, PHIv are the amplitudes and phase lags (in degrees) of
        u- and v- tidal current components. They can be vectors or
        matrices or multidimensional arrays.

        plot_demo is an optional argument, when it is supplied as an array
        of indices, say [i j k l], the program will plot an ellipse
        corresponding to Au[i, j, k, l], PHIu[i, j, k, l], Av[i, j, k, l], and
        PHIv[i, j, k, l]. Defaults to False (i.e. no plot).

        Any number of dimensions are allowed as long as your computer
        resource can handle.

        SEMA: Semi-major axes, or the maximum speed.

        ECC:  Eccentricity, the ratio of semi-minor axis over the semi-major
              axis; its negative value indicates that the ellipse is traversed
              in clockwise direction.

        INC:  Inclination, the angles (in degrees) between the semi-major axes
              and u-axis.

        PHA:  Phase angles, the time (in angles and in degrees) when the tidal
              currents reach their maximum speeds,  (i.e.  PHA=omega*tmax).

              These four ep-parameters will have the same dimensionality (i.e.,
              vectors, or matrices) as the input ap-parameters.

        w:    A matrix whose rows allow for plotting ellipses and whose columns
              are for different ellipses corresponding columnwise to SEMA. For
              example, plot(np.real(w[0, :]), np.imag(w[0, :])) will let you
              see the first ellipse. You may need to use squeeze function when
              w is a more than two dimensional array. See example.py.

    Document:   tidal_ellipse.ps

    Revisions: May  2002, by Zhigang Xu,  --- adopting Foreman's northern semi
    major axis convention.

    For a given ellipse, its semi-major axis is undetermined by 180. If we
    borrow Foreman's terminology to call a semi major axis whose direction lies
    in a range of [0, 180) as the northern semi-major axis and otherwise as a
    southern semi major axis, one has freedom to pick up either northern or
    southern one as the semi major axis without affecting anything else.
    Foreman (1977) resolves the ambiguity by always taking the northern one as
    the semi-major axis. This revision is made to adopt Foreman's convention.
    Note the definition of the phase, PHA, is still defined as the angle
    between the initial current vector, but when converted into the maximum
    current time, it may not give the time when the maximum current first
    happens; it may give the second time that the current reaches the maximum
    (obviously, the 1st and 2nd maximum current times are half tidal period
    apart) depending on where the initial current vector happen to be and its
    rotating sense.
