<h3>Python?</h3>
<p>Python is an <em>interpreted, interactive, object-oriented</em> programming
language.  It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java.</p>

<p>Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.  It has
modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and
dynamic typing.  There are interfaces to many system calls and
libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk,
Mac, MFC, wxWidgets).  New built-in modules are easily written in C or
C++.  Python is also usable as an extension language for applications
that need a programmable interface.</p>
<p>The Python implementation is portable: it runs on many brands of UNIX,
on Windows, OS/2, Mac, Amiga, and many other platforms.</p>

<p>Some of Python's notable features: </p>
<ul>
<li>Python uses an elegant syntax for readable programs.
</li>
<li>Python is an agile language that makes it easy to get your program working. This makes Python an ideal language for prototype development and other ad-hoc programming tasks, without compromising maintainability.
</li>
<li>A variety of basic data types are available: numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimited-length long integers), strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, dictionaries.
</li>
<li>Python supports object-oriented programming with classes and multiple inheritance.
</li>
<li>Code can be grouped into modules and packages.
</li>

<li>The language supports raising and catching exceptions, resulting in cleaner error handling.
</li>
<li>Data types are strongly and dynamically typed. Mixing incompatible types (e.g. attempting to add a string and a number) causes an exception to be raised.
</li>
<li>Python contains advanced programming features such as generators and list comprehensions.
</li>
<li>Automatic garbage collection frees you from the hassles of memory management.
</li>
<li>The large standard library supports many common programming tasks such as connecting to web servers, regular expressions, and file handling.

</li>
<li>Python's interactive mode makes it easy to test short snippets of code. There's also a bundled development environment called IDLE.
</li>
<li>The Python interpreter is easily extended by adding new modules implemented in a compiled language such as C or C++.
</li>
<li>The interpreter can also be embedded into an application to provide a programmable interface.
</li>
<li>Python runs on many different computers and operating systems: Windows, MacOS, many brands of Unix, OS/2, ...
</li>

</ul>

<p>We will not discuss the specifics of Python here but instead refer the reader to the

<h3>Python and lpsolve</h3>

<p>lpsolve is callable from Python via an extension or module. As such, it looks like lpsolve is fully integrated
with Python. Matrices can directly be transferred between Python and lpsolve in both directions. The complete interface
is written in C so it has maximum performance. The whole lpsolve API is implemented with some extra's specific for
Python (especially for matrix support). So you have full control to the complete lpsolve functionality via the lpsolve
Python driver.

If you find that this involves too much work to solve an lp model then you can also work via higher-level
script files that can make things a lot easier. See further in this article.
</p>

<p>Python is ideally suited to handle linear programming problems.
These are problems in which you have a quantity, depending linearly on several variables,
that you want to maximize or minimize subject to several constraints that are expressed
as linear inequalities in the same variables. If the number of variables and the number
of constraints are small, then there are numerous mathematical techniques for solving a
linear programming problem.
Indeed these techniques are often taught in high school or university level
courses in finite mathematics. But sometimes these numbers are high, or even if low,
the constants in the linear inequalities or the object expression for the quantity
to be optimised may be numerically complicated in which case a software package like
Python is required to effect a solution.</p>

<a name="Installation"></a>
<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>To make this possible, a driver program is needed: lpsolve55.pyd.
This driver must be put in a directory known to Python and Python can call the lpsolve solver.</p>

<p>This driver calls lpsolve via the lpsolve shared library (lpsolve55.dll under Windows
and liblpsolve55.so under Unix/Linux) (archive lp_solve_5.5_dev.zip/lp_solve_5.5_dev.tar.gz). This has the advantage that the lpsolve driver doesn't have to
be recompiled when an update of lpsolve is provided. The shared library must be somewhere in the Windows path.</p>

<p>So note the difference between the Python lpsolve driver that is called lpsolve and the lpsolve library that implements the
API that is called lpsolve55.</p>

<p>There are also some Python script files (.py) as a quick start.</p>

<p>See <a href="#Install_the_lpsolve_driver">Install the lpsolve driver</a> for the installation of these files.</p>

<p>To test if everything is installed correctly, enter the following in the Python command window.</p>

<!--
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; import lpsolve55
&gt;&gt;&gt; lpsolve55.lpsolve()
</pre>
-->

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; from lpsolve55 import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; lpsolve()
</pre>

<p>If it gives the following, then everything is ok:</p>

<pre>lpsolve Python Interface version 5.5.0.4
using lpsolve version 5.5.0.8

Usage: [ret1, ret2, ...] = lpsolve('functionname', arg1, arg2, ...)
</pre>

<p>If you get the following:</p>

<pre>This application has failed to start because lpsolve55.dll was not found.
Re-installing the application may fix this problem.</pre>

<p>Or (Unix/Linux):</p>

<pre>liblpsolve55.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.</pre>

<p>Then Python can find the lpsolve driver program, but the driver program cannot find the lpsolve library
that contains the lpsolve implementation.
This library is called lpsolve55.dll under Windows and liblpsolve55.so under Unix/Linux.<br>
Under Windows, the lpsolve55.dll file must be in a directory that in the PATH environment variable.
This path can be shown via the following command in Python: !PATH<br>
It is common to place this in the WINDOWS\system32 folder.<br>
<br>
Under Unix/Linux, the liblpsolve55.so shared library must be either in the directories /lib or /usr/lib or in
a directory specified by the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

<h3>Solve an lp model from Python via lpsolve</h3>

<p>In the following text, &gt;&gt;&gt; before the Python commands is the Python prompt.
Only the text after &gt;&gt;&gt; must be entered.
</p>

<p>To call an lpsolve function, the following syntax must be used:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; [ret1, ret2, ...] = lpsolve('functionname', arg1, arg2, ...)</pre>

<p>The return values are optional and depend on the function called. functionname must always be enclosed between single
quotes to make it alphanumerical and it is case sensitive. The number and type of arguments depend on the function called.
Some functions even have a variable number of arguments and a different behaviour occurs depending on the type of the argument.
functionname can be (almost) any of the lpsolve API routines (see <a href="lp_solveAPIreference.htm">lp_solve API reference</a>)
plus some extra Python specific functions.
Most of the lpsolve API routines use or return an lprec structure. To make things more robust in Python, this structure
is replaced by a handle or the model name. The lprec structures are maintained internally by the lpsolve driver.
The handle is an incrementing number starting from 0.
Starting from driver version 5.5.0.2, it is also possible to use the model name instead of the handle.
This can of course only be done if a name is given to the model. This is done via lpsolve routine
<a href="#set_lp_name">set_lp_name</a> or by specifying the model name in routine <a href="#read_lp">read_lp</a>.
See <a href="#Using_model_name_instead_of_handle">Using model name instead of handle</a>.
</p>

<p>Almost all callable functions can be found in the <a href="lp_solveAPIreference.htm">lp_solve API reference</a>.
Some are exactly as described in the reference guide, others have a slightly different syntax to make maximum
use of the Python functionality. For example make_lp is used identical as described. But get_variables is slightly
different. In the API reference, this function has two arguments. The first the lp handle and the second the
resulting variables and this array must already be dimensioned. When lpsolve is used from Python, nothing must
be dimensioned in advance. The lpsolve driver takes care of dimensioning all return variables and they are
always returned as return value of the call to lpsolve. Never as argument to the routine. This can be a single
value as for get_objective or a matrix or vector as in get_variables.
In this case, get_variables returns a 4x1 matrix (vector) with the result of the 4 variables of the lp model.
</p>

<p>Note that you can get a usage of lpsolve, its arguments and the constants that it defines by entering the following in Python:</p>

<p>Note that there are commands that return an answer. If they do and their result is not stored in a
variable, then it is echoed on screen. If assigned to a variable then the value is not echoed. For example:
</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; obj = lpsolve('get_objective', lp)
</pre>

<p>The result in then not shown on screen. But the contents of the variable can be printed:</p>

<p>Or even:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; obj
31.782758620689656</pre>

<p>Note that get_variables and get_constraints return two results: The result vector and a status. If only the
vector is needed, then [0] can be used as in the example. Or the result can be stored in an extra variables:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; [x, ret] = lpsolve('get_variables', lp)

<p>Variable x will contain the result vector and ret the return status of the call.</p>

.
.
.
&gt;&gt;&gt; lpsolve55.lpsolve('delete_lp', lp)</pre>

<p>This technique will not be used in this description because the lpsolve library is not really object oriented structured.
But if you prefer it, there is nothing that should stop you.
The only difference is that you have to put lpsolve55. before every lpsolve function and constant.</p>

<a name="Using_model_name_instead_of_handle"></a>
<h3>Using model name instead of handle</h3>
From driver version 5.5.0.2, it is possible to use the model name instead of the handle. From the moment the model
has a name, you can use this name instead of the handle. This is best shown by an example. Above example would look
like this:

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from lpsolve55 import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; lp = lpsolve('make_lp', 0, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = lpsolve('set_lp_name', lp, 'mymodel')
&gt;&gt;&gt; lpsolve('set_verbose', 'mymodel', IMPORTANT)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = lpsolve('set_obj_fn', 'mymodel', [1, 3, 6.24, 0.1])
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = lpsolve('add_constraint', 'mymodel', [0, 78.26, 0, 2.9], GE, 92.3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = lpsolve('add_constraint', 'mymodel', [0.24, 0, 11.31, 0], LE, 14.8)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = lpsolve('add_constraint', 'mymodel', [12.68, 0, 0.08, 0.9], GE, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = lpsolve('set_lowbo', 'mymodel', 1, 28.6)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = lpsolve('set_lowbo', 'mymodel', 4, 18)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = lpsolve('set_upbo', 'mymodel', 4, 48.98)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = lpsolve('set_col_name', 'mymodel', 1, 'COLONE')
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = lpsolve('set_col_name', 'mymodel', 2, 'COLTWO')
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = lpsolve('set_col_name', 'mymodel', 3, 'COLTHREE')
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = lpsolve('set_col_name', 'mymodel', 4, 'COLFOUR')
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = lpsolve('set_row_name', 'mymodel', 1, 'THISROW')
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = lpsolve('set_row_name', 'mymodel', 2, 'THATROW')
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = lpsolve('set_row_name', 'mymodel', 3, 'LASTROW')
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = lpsolve('write_lp', 'mymodel', 'a.lp')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print lpsolve('get_mat', 'mymodel', 1, 2)
78.26
&gt;&gt;&gt; lpsolve('solve', 'mymodel')
0L
&gt;&gt;&gt; print lpsolve('get_objective', 'mymodel')
31.7827586207
&gt;&gt;&gt; print lpsolve('get_variables', 'mymodel')[0]
[28.600000000000001, 0.0, 0.0, 31.827586206896552]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print lpsolve('get_constraints', 'mymodel')[0]
[92.299999999999997, 6.863999999999999, 391.2928275862069]
</pre>

<p>So everywhere a handle is needed, you can also use the model name. You can even mix the two methods.
There is also a specific Python routine to get the handle from the model name: <a href="#get_handle">get_handle</a>.<br>
For example:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; lp = lpsolve('get_handle', 'mymodel')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print lp
0
</pre>

<p>Don't forget to free the handle and its associated memory when you are done:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; lpsolve('delete_lp', 'mymodel')</pre>

<p>In the next part of this documentation, the handle is used. But if you name the model, the name could thus also be used.</p>

<a name="Matrices"></a>
<h3>Matrices</h3>
lpsolve uses Python lists to represent matrices (and vectors). Note that lpsolve can only work with real numbers, not complex numbers.
For example:
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; lpsolve('add_constraint', lp, [0.24, 0, 11.31, 0], 1, 14.8)</pre>

<p>[0.24, 0, 11.31, 0] is a list type variable.</p>

<p>Most of the time, variables are used to provide the data:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; lpsolve('add_constraint', lp, a1, 1, 14.8)</pre>

<p>Where a1 is a variable of type list. Sometimes a two-dimensional matrix is used:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; lpsolve('set_mat', lp, [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])</pre>

<p>[1, 2, 3] is the first row and [4, 5, 6] is the second row.</p>

<p>The lpsolve driver sees all provided matrices as sparse matrices. lpsolve uses sparse matrices
internally and data can be provided sparse via the ex routines. For example add_constraintex. The lpsolve
driver always uses the ex routines to provide the data to lpsolve. Even if you call from Python the routine
names that would require a dense matrix (for example add_constraint), the lpsolve driver will always call the
sparse version of the routine (for example add_constraintex). This results in the most performing behaviour.
Matrices with too few or too much elements gives an 'invalid vector.' error.</p>

<p>An important final note. Several lp_solve API routines accept a vector where the first element (element 0) is not used.
Other lp_solve API calls do use the first element. In the Python interface, there is never an unused element in the matrices.
So if the lp_solve API specifies that the first element is not used, then this element is not in the Python matrix.</p>

<a name="Maximum_usage_of_matrices_with_lpsolve"></a>
<h3>Maximum usage of matrices with lpsolve</h3>

<p>Because Python has the list possibility to represent vectors, all lpsolve API routines that need a column or row number to get/set information for that
column/row are extended in the lpsolve Python driver to also work with vectors. For example set_int in the API can
only set the integer status for one column. If the status for several integer variables must be set, then set_int
must be called multiple times. The lpsolve Python driver however also allows specifying a vector to set the integer
status of all variables at once. The API call is: return = lpsolve('set_int', lp, column, must_be_int). The
matrix version of this call is: return = lpsolve('set_int', lp, [must_be_int]).
The API call to return the integer status of a variable is: return = lpsolve('is_int', lp, column). The
matrix version of this call is: [is_int] = lpsolve('is_int', lp)<br>
Also note the get_mat and set_mat routines. In Python these are extended to return/set the complete constraint matrix.
See following example.

<p>Above example can thus also be done as follows:<br>

<p>Note the usage of Infinite in set_upbo. This stands for 'infinity'. Meaning an infinite upper bound.
It is also possible to use -Infinite to express minus infinity. This can for example be used to create a free variable.
Infinite is a constant defined by the lpsolve library.</p>

<p>To show the full power of the matrices, let's now do some matrix calculations to check the solution.
It works further on above example. Note that Python doesn't support matrix calculations on lists.
However, there are several numerical packages that can do this. The list type variables must be converted to
the matrix types of these packages. A common known package for this is Numeric. It is not installed by default but can be
easily installed.
See <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&amp;package_id=1351">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&amp;package_id=1351</a>.
There are newer packages like SciPy: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&amp;package_id=6222">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&amp;package_id=6222</a>.
See <a href="http://numeric.scipy.org/">http://numeric.scipy.org/</a> for a brief overview. This documentation works with Numeric to do the math calculations.</p>

<p>We even don't have to explicitly convert the lists to matrices:</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt; a

<p>matrixmultiply returns not a list, but a Numeric array object.
If the result is needed again in a list, then this can be easily done:</p>

<p>So what we have done here is calculate the values of the constraints (RHS) by multiplying the constraint matrix
with the solution vector. Now take a look at the values of the constraints that lpsolve has found:</p>

<p>Exactly the same as the calculated B vector, as expected.</p>

<p>Also the value of the objective can be calculated in a same way:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; c = lpsolve('get_obj_fn', lp)[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = lpsolve('get_variables', lp)[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; obj = matrixmultiply(c, x)
&gt;&gt;&gt; obj

<p>So what we have done here is calculate the value of the objective by multiplying the objective vector

<h3>A practical example</h3>

<p>We shall illustrate the method of linear programming by means of a simple example,
giving a combination graphical/numerical solution, and then solve both a slightly as well as a substantially
more complicated problem.</p>

<p>Suppose a farmer has 75 acres on which to plant two crops: wheat and barley.
To produce these crops, it costs the farmer (for seed, fertilizer, etc.) $120 per acre for the
wheat and  $210 per acre for the barley. The farmer has $15000 available for expenses.
But after the harvest, the farmer must store the crops while awaiting favourable market conditions.
The farmer has storage space for 4000 bushels. Each acre yields an average of 110 bushels of wheat
or 30 bushels of barley.  If the net profit per bushel of wheat (after all expenses have been subtracted)
is $1.30 and for barley is $2.00, how should the farmer plant the 75 acres to maximize profit?</p>

<p>We begin by formulating the problem mathematically. 
First we express the objective, that is the profit, and the constraints
algebraically, then we graph them, and lastly we arrive at the solution
by graphical inspection and a minor arithmetic calculation.</p>

<p>Let x denote the number of acres allotted to wheat and y the number of acres allotted to barley.
Then the expression to be maximized, that is the profit, is clearly</p>

<p align="center">P = (110)(1.30)x + (30)(2.00)y = 143x + 60y.</p>

<p>There are three constraint inequalities, specified by the limits on expenses, storage and acreage.
They are respectively:</p>

<p align="center">
120x + 210y &lt;= 15000<br>
110x + 30y &lt;= 4000<br>
x + y &lt;= 75
</p>

<p>Strictly speaking there are two more constraint inequalities forced by the fact that the farmer cannot plant
a negative number of acres, namely:</p>

<p align="center">x &gt;= 0, y &gt;= 0.</p>

<p>Next we graph the regions specified by the constraints. The last two say that we only need to consider
the first quadrant in the x-y plane. Here's a graph delineating the triangular region in the first quadrant determined
by the first inequality.</p>

<p><IMG alt="Source" src="O-Matrix1.jpg" border="0"></p>

<p>Now let's put in the other two constraint inequalities.</p>

<p><IMG alt="Source" src="O-Matrix2.jpg" border="0"></p>

<p>The black area is the solution space that holds valid solutions. This means that any point in this area fulfils the
constraints.
</p>

<p>Now let's superimpose on top of this picture a contour plot of the objective function P.</p>

<p><IMG alt="Source" src="O-Matrix3.jpg" border="0"></p>

<p>The lines give a picture of the objective function.
All solutions that intersect with the black area are valid solutions, meaning that this result also fulfils
the set constraints. The more the lines go to the right, the higher the objective value is. The optimal solution
or best objective is a line that is still in the black area, but with an as large as possible value.
</p>

<p>It seems apparent that the maximum value of P will occur on the level curve (that is, level
line) that passes through the vertex of the polygon that lies near (22,53).<br>
It is the intersection of x + y = 75 and 110*x + 30*y = 4000<br>
This is a corner point of the diagram. This is not a coincidence. The simplex algorithm, which is used
by lpsolve, starts from a theorem that the optimal solution is such a corner point.<br>
In fact we can compute the result:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; from Numeric import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; from LinearAlgebra import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = matrixmultiply(inverse(array([[1, 1], [110, 30]])), array([75, 4000]))
&gt;&gt;&gt; print x
[ 21.875  53.125]
</pre>

<p>The acreage that results in the maximum profit is 21.875 for wheat and 53.125 for barley.
In that case the profit is:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; P = matrixmultiply(array([143, 60]), x)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print P
6315.625
</pre>

<p>That is, $6315.625.</p>

<p>Note that these command are in script example3.py</p>

<p>Now, lp_solve comes into the picture to solve this linear programming problem more generally.
After that we will use it to solve two more complicated problems involving more variables
and constraints.</p>

<p>For this example, we use the higher-level script lp_maker to build the model and then some lp_solve API calls
to retrieve the solution. Here is again the usage of lp_maker:</p>

<pre>
 LP_MAKER  Makes mixed integer linear programming problems.

   SYNOPSIS: lp_handle = lp_maker(f,a,b,e,vlb,vub,xint,scalemode,setminim)
      make the MILP problem
        max v = f'*x
          a*x &lt;&gt; b
            vlb &lt;= x &lt;= vub
            x(int) are integer

   ARGUMENTS: The first four arguments are required:
            f: n vector of coefficients for a linear objective function.
            a: m by n matrix representing linear constraints.
            b: m vector of right sides for the inequality constraints.
            e: m vector that determines the sense of the inequalities:
                      e(i) &lt; 0  ==&gt; Less Than
                      e(i) = 0  ==&gt; Equals
                      e(i) &gt; 0  ==&gt; Greater Than
          vlb: n vector of non-negative lower bounds. If empty or omitted,
               then the lower bounds are set to zero.
          vub: n vector of upper bounds. May be omitted or empty.
         xint: vector of integer variables. May be omitted or empty.
    scalemode: Autoscale flag. Off when 0 or omitted.
     setminim: Set maximum lp when this flag equals 0 or omitted.

   OUTPUT: lp_handle is an integer handle to the lp created.
</pre>

<p>Now let's formulate this model with lp_solve:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from lp_maker import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = [143, 60]
&gt;&gt;&gt; A = [[120, 210], [110, 30], [1, 1]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [15000, 4000, 75]
&gt;&gt;&gt; lp = lp_maker(f, A, b, [-1, -1, -1], None, None, None, 1, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; solvestat = lpsolve('solve', lp)
&gt;&gt;&gt; obj = lpsolve('get_objective', lp)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print obj
6315.625
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = lpsolve('get_variables', lp)[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print x
[21.874999999999993, 53.125000000000007]
&gt;&gt;&gt; lpsolve('delete_lp', lp)
</pre>

<p>Note that these command are in script example4.py</p>

<p>With the higher-level script lp_maker, we provide all data to lp_solve. lp_solve returns a handle (lp) to the
created model. Then the API call 'solve' is used to calculate the optimal solution of the model.
The value of the objective function is retrieved via the API call 'get_objective' and the values of the variables
are retrieved via the API call 'get_variables'. At last, the model is removed from memory via a call to 'delete_lp'.
Don't forget this to free all memory allocated by lp_solve.</p>

<p>The solution is the same answer we obtained before. 
Note that the non-negativity constraints are accounted implicitly because variables are by default non-negative
in lp_solve.</p>

<p>Well, we could have done this problem by hand (as shown in the introduction) because it is very small and it
can be graphically presented.<br>
Now suppose that the farmer is dealing with a third crop, say corn, and that the corresponding data is:</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellSpacing="1" cellPadding="1" border="1">
<tr><td>cost per acre</td><td>$150.75</td></tr>
<tr><td>yield per acre</td><td>125 bushels</td></tr>
<tr><td>profit per bushel</td><td>$1.56</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>With three variables it is already a lot more difficult to show this model graphically. Adding more variables
makes it even impossible because we can't imagine anymore how to represent this. We only have a practical understanding
of 3 dimensions, but beyond that it is all very theoretical.</p>

<p>If we denote the number of acres allotted to corn by z, then the objective function becomes:</p>

<p align="center">P = (110)(1.30)x + (30)(2.00)y + (125)(1.56) = 143x + 60y + 195z</p>

<p>And the constraint inequalities are:</p>

<p align="center">
120x + 210y + 150.75z &lt;= 15000<br>
110x + 30y + 125z &lt;= 4000<br>
x + y + z &lt;= 75<br>
x &gt;= 0, y &gt;= 0, z &gt;= 0
</p>

<p>The problem is solved with lp_solve as follows:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from lp_maker import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = [143, 60, 195]
&gt;&gt;&gt; A = [[120, 210, 150.75], [110, 30, 125], [1, 1, 1]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [15000, 4000, 75]
&gt;&gt;&gt; lp = lp_maker(f, A, b, [-1, -1, -1], None, None, None, 1, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; solvestat = lpsolve('solve', lp)
&gt;&gt;&gt; obj = lpsolve('get_objective', lp)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print obj
6986.84210526
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = lpsolve('get_variables', lp)[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print x
[0.0, 56.578947368421055, 18.421052631578945]
&gt;&gt;&gt; lpsolve('delete_lp', lp)
</pre>

<p>Note that these command are in script example5.py</p>

<p>So the farmer should ditch the wheat and plant 56.5789 acres of barley and 18.4211 acres of corn.</p>

<p>There is no practical limit on the number of variables and constraints that Python can handle.
Certainly none that the relatively unsophisticated user will encounter. Indeed, in
many true applications of the technique of linear programming, one needs
to deal with many variables and constraints. The solution of such
a problem by hand is not feasible, and software like Python is crucial
to success. For example, in the farming problem with which we
have been working, one could have more crops than two or three. Think
agribusiness instead of family farmer. And one could have constraints
that arise from other things beside expenses, storage and acreage limitations. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Availability of seed. This might lead to constraint inequalities like xj &lt; k.</li>
  <li>Personal preferences. Thus the farmer's spouse might have a preference
  for one variety over another and insist on a corresponding planting,
  or something similar with a collection of crops; thus constraint inequalities
  like xi &lt; xj or x1 + x2 &gt; x3.</li>
  <li>Government subsidies. It may take a moment's reflection on the reader's part,
  but this could lead to inequalities like xj &gt; k.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a sequence of commands that solves exactly such a problem.
You should be able to recognize the objective expression and the constraints from the data that is entered. 
But as an aid, you might answer the following questions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many crops are under consideration?</li>
  <li>What are the corresponding expenses? How much is available for expenses?</li>
  <li>What are the yields in each case? What is the storage capacity?</li>
  <li>How many acres are available?</li>
  <li>What crops are constrained by seed limitations? To what extent?</li>
  <li>What about preferences?</li>
  <li>What are the minimum acreages for each crop?</li>
</ul>

&gt;&gt;&gt; lpsolve('delete_lp', lp)
</pre>

<p>Note that these command are in script example6.py</p>

<p>Note that we have used in this formulation the vlb and vub arguments of lp_maker. This to set lower and upper bounds
on variables. This could have been done via extra constraints, but it is more performant to set bounds on variables.
Also note that Infinity is used for variables that have no upper limit.
</p>

<p>Note that despite the complexity of the problem, lp_solve solves it almost instantaneously. It seems the
farmer should bet the farm on crop number 6. We strongly suggest
you alter the expense and/or the storage limit in the problem and see
what effect that has on the answer.</p>

<a name="Another,_more_theoretical,_example"></a>
<h3>Another, more theoretical, example</h3>

<p>Suppose we want to solve the following linear program using Python:</p>
<p align="center">
max 4x1 + 2x2 + x3<br>
s. t. 2x1 + x2 &lt;= 1<br>
x1 + 2x3 &lt;= 2<br>
x1 + x2 + x3 = 1<br>
x1 &gt;= 0<br>
x1 &lt;= 1<br>
x2 &gt;= 0<br>
x2 &lt;= 1<br>
x3 &gt;= 0<br>
x3 &lt;= 2<br>
</p>

<p>Convert the LP into Python format we get:</p>

<p align="center">
f = [4, 2, 1]<br>
A = [[2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 2], [1, 1, 1]]<br>
b = [1, 2, 1]
</p>

<p>Note that constraints on single variables are not put in the constraint matrix.
lp_solve can set bounds on individual variables and this is more performant than creating
additional constraints. These bounds are:
</p>

<p align="center">
l = [ 0, 0, 0]<br>
u = [ 1, 1, 2]
</p>

<p>Now lets enter this in Python:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = [4, 2, 1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; A = [[2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 2], [1, 1, 1]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [1, 2, 1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [ 0, 0, 0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; u = [ 1, 1, 2]
</pre>

<p>Now solve the linear program using Python: Type the commands</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from lpsolve55 import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; from lp_maker import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; lp = lp_maker(f, A, b, [-1, -1, -1], l, u, None, 1, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; solvestat = lpsolve('solve', lp)
&gt;&gt;&gt; obj = lpsolve('get_objective', lp)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print obj
2.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = lpsolve('get_variables', lp)[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print x
[0.5, 0.0, 0.5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; lpsolve('delete_lp', lp)
</pre>

<p>What to do when some of the variables are missing ?<br>
For example, suppose there are no lower bounds on the variables. In this case define l to be the empty set using the Python command:
</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = None
</pre>

<p>This has the same effect as before, because lp_solve has as default lower bound for variables 0.</p>

<p>But what if you want that variables may also become negative?<br>
Then you can use -Infinite as lower bounds:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [-Infinite, -Infinite, -Infinite]
</pre>

<p>Solve this and you get a different result:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; lp = lp_maker(f, A, b, [-1, -1, -1], l, u, None, 1, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; solvestat = lpsolve('solve', lp)
&gt;&gt;&gt; obj = lpsolve('get_objective', lp)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print obj
2.66666666667
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = lpsolve('get_variables', lp)[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print x
[0.66666666666666674, -0.33333333333333348, 0.66666666666666674]

<h3>Compile the lpsolve driver</h3>

<p>The lpsolve Python driver is called lpsolve55.pyd (windows) and lpsolve55.so (Unix).<br>
This driver is an interface to the lpsolve55.dll (windows) and liblpsolve55.so (Unix) lpsolve shared library that contains the implementation of lp_solve.
lpsolve55.dll/liblpsolve55.so is distributed with the lp_solve package (archive lp_solve_5.5_dev.zip/lp_solve_5.5_dev.tar.gz). The lpsolve Python driver is just
a wrapper between Python and lp_solve to translate the input/output to/from Python and the lp_solve library.
</p>

<p>The lpsolve Python driver is written in C. To compile this code a C compiler is needed.
Under Unix, this is the standard C compiler (c/gcc) and under windows it is the Microsoft compiler from Visual Studio .NET.
This compiler must be called from Python. To make the compilation process easier, a Python script can be used:
setup.py<br>
To compile and install the package, just enter the following in a command prompt/shell:</p>

<pre>
python setup.py install
</pre>

<p>and everything is done.</p>

<a name="Install_the_lpsolve_driver"></a>
<h3>Install the lpsolve driver</h3>

<p>Under Windows, there is an installer that installs the Python lpsolve driver and the supporting scripts lp_maker.py
and lp_solve.py. Just run lpsolve55-5.5.0.4.win32-py2.4.exe (this installer is in archive lp_solve_5.5_Python_exe.zip).<br>
On other platforms, the lpsolve driver must be compiled as described in the previous section: <a href="#Compile_the_lpsolve_driver">Compile the lpsolve driver</a><br>
Don't forget that lpsolve55.dll (Windows) or liblpsolve55.so (Unix/Linux) is also needed for this (In archive lp_solve_5.5_dev.zip).
